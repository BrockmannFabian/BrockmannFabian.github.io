This article explains the fundamental components of smart charging or should we say a **smart charging person**?

Smart charging can be understood in various ways, and different authors have their own definitions. It is influenced by the design of the electricity market, the technical characteristics of the electricity grid, and the EV owner's capacity to offer flexibility. We will explore these three components in the following sections.

## Design of the electricty market

Electricty can be traded on different power exchange markets, for different bidding zones and different time slots. Most smart charging applications focus on the day ahead market. On this market electricty producer and consumer can submit bids for each hour of the following trading day. Producer submit bids in the form of an amount of electricty, a price for that amount and a hour of delivery. Consumer submit bids in the same form but they do not want to deliver they want to consume. The bids have to be submitted to the market until gate closure (in most markets around noon). After the gate closure time, the power exchange market determines the demand curve from producer orders and the supply curve from consumer orders for each delivery period. The intersection of these curves represents the market clearing price, which applies to all accepted buy and sell orders. Buy orders with prices at or above the market clearing price are accepted, as are sell orders with prices at or below it. This process ensures transparency and fairness for all market participants. Once market results are confirmed, all accepted buy and sell orders become binding transactions, which are then cleared and settled by the clearing service providers
