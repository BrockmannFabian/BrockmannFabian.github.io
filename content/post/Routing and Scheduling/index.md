## The core idea
Routing and scheduling are essential activities for all transportation companies to create operational plans for their vehicles and drivers. These tasks can be performed manually by an operational planner or, more commonly today, by using software solutions to support the planner.

The operational planner faces a complex task: managing a fleet of vehicles to transport goods to a set of customers. The planner must determine the sequence of customer visits for each vehicle in the fleet, known as **Routing**. The problem to be solved is referred to as the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**.

In addition to routing, the planner must schedule the activities along the route, particularly in terms of timing. This process, known as **Scheduling**, includes tasks such as planning mandatory breaks for drivers. The problem to be solved is referred to as the **Truck Driver Scheduling Problem (TDSP)**.
