## The core idea
Routing and Scheduling are both activities all transportation companies must perform to create operational plans for their vehicles and drivers. This operational planning can be done manually by an operational planner or by a software solution. Today, most companies use software to at least support the operational planner. The planner faces the following problem, A fleet of vehicles can be used to transport a set of goods to a set of customers. The planner will create a sequence of customers to be visited for each vehicle in the fleet. This is known as **Routing**, the problem solved to do the routing is called the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**. In addition to routing, the planner also has to schedule the activities along the route in terms of timing. This is called **Scheduling**. It typically involves scheduling of mandatory breaks.
