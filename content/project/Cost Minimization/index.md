<b> Disclaimer </b> This blog post delves into the cost benefits of a smart charging application. To avoid building a narrow-minded opinion, it is crucial to understand which components are genuinely part of &quot;smart charging&quot;. To refresh your knowledge, you can read the introductory explanation of smart charging here.

Soon, households may face time-dependent electricity prices, based on the day-ahead price of their respective bidding zone. At the same time, more and more households own an electric vehicle. Since vehicle owners have some flexibility in when to recharge the vehicle, they can adopt cost-minimizing (smart) charging applications. The resulting costs of these highly depend on when the vehicle owner plugs in the vehicle. Therefore, we define different charging strategies and compare their resulting costs for 2020 â€“ 2023. Results from one German electricity market show that through all the years, using a smart charging application overnight results in the lowest costs, when charging on any given day of the week. However, solely focusing on Sundays results in even lower costs. I also provide numerical results for France, Spain, UK, and Norway 1.
