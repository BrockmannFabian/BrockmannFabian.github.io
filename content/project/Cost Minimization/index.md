**Disclaimer**: This blog post delves into the cost benefits of a smart charging application. It's crucial to understand which components are genuinely part of "smart charging." To refresh your knowledge, you can read the introductory explanation of smart charging here.

**Abstract**: In this article, I explore the cost benefits of applying smart charging techniques in different European countries over a time horizon from 2020 until 2023. As smart charging applications, I adopt a cost-minimizing strategy, which exploits a time-dependent electricity price. We assume EV owners follow a myopic behavior in which they do not pay attention to electricity prices, but plug-in their vehicle at predefined times. The actual cost-minimization is done by a flexible charging strategy, which controls the charging of the EV. As a result, I show that the myopic choice of an EV owner has a great influence on charging costs. Explanation of the Analysis are provided for Germany. I also provide the results and some minor explanations for Norway 1, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain.
